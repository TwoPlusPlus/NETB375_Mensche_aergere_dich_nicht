C++ game - Mensche_aergere_dich_nicht 
=========================
Check wiki for the rule set and game plan.


Master branch is for a tested build. Everything must be working.

Test branch is were we test the build.

Develop branch is were we are going to push changes to the project. Only working features.


From the Develop branch there will be different branches for files, classes ect. Once something is ready and working we will push it to Develop branch. Then as we get a working build and it's ready for testing as a whole we will push it to Test branch and if it is working like it should -> master branch.
